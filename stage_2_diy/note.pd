#X text 90 10 This file defines an object: "note". Objects defined
by files share the file's name. "inlet" defines an inlet for the object.

#X text 131 85 "unpack" \, "mtof" and "phasor" all work the same way
as stage 1 \; however \, this time we use a subtract "-~" object to
center our "phasor~" signal about the x-axis (meaning the values now
range from -0.5 to 0.5 instead of 0 to 1). This helps avoid clipping
when we add our 8 voices together.;
#X text 217 231 We add in a "sel" object with an argument of 0 to stop
a velocity value of 0 (given when a note is released) from stopping
the note. This would interfere with out envelope's release functionality.
Wihtout this \, any note would stop immediately despite your release
setting.;
#X text 199 313 "adsr" is another object we've defined in a file ("adsr.pd")
This object takes in the velocity and outputs a value from 0 to 1 just
like our standard velocity division does. However \, this value varies
with time \, so our synth will have dynamic dynamics so to speak.;
#X text 89 440 "outlet~" defines out objects output.;
