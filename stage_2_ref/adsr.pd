#X text 183 508 "line~" takes a list that contains a time and an end
value and ouputs a singal that ramps to that value from its current
value in that time. This receives packed lists from the Release \,
Attack and Decay/Sustain;
#X text 469 34 This object is a little messier than the others. You
can see we have an "inlet" connected to a "sel 0" object meaning inputs
equal to zero are sent to the left outlet while non-zero inputs are
sent to the right. When a key is pressed \, the right outlet of the
"sel 0" object is set to whatever the input value is. This then sends
that value to a "trigger" or "t" object that triggers 3 bangs (written
as 3 b arguments). These bangs activate right to left \, so first the
value 0 is sent to "line~" to initialize it. Then the attack time is
packed with 1 and sent to "line~" to start ramping up to max amplitude.
Then the "delay" block is triggered. The delay block is only activated
when its left inlet is given a bang. This is called a "hot" inlet.
The left inlet is the "cold" inlet and does not trigger the delay object:
it only sets the delay time. Since the attack time value + 1 is routed
to the cold inlet \, the "delay" object triggers the Decay pack after
an amount of time equal to the attack time setting plus one millisecond
(to avoid Decay coming in too early at small attack times). The pack
containing decay time and sustain value is then sent to line~ to start
ramping to the sustain value over the decay time. When a key is released
\, the "sel 0" object then activates a "stop" message (it is NOT and
object \, it is a MESSAGE) which stops the the delay if it has been
triggered. It also packs the release time value with a value of 0 so
"line~" will ramp to zero over th release time.;
